        <h2>History</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Qube Living Outdoor was created from the acquisition of the Projects division of Blok Security in several years ago.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After further expansion of Qube, it was decided in 2022 to build a new showroom of more than 300mÂ² in Westerlo. 
         This will allow Qube to let you experience the outdoor feeling even more with an extensive range of products! 
         With our only pride, we opened the showroom in spring 2023 at the new location on the Olenseweg.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our know-how, competences and an enthusiastic assembly team combined with high-quality products are the keys to Qube's success.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <br>
        <p>All our suppliers were selected based on their years of experience and specialisation. 
        Based on this know-how, they have succeeded in bringing top products onto the market. 
        This combined with correct installation by our own trained staff ensures that your installation adds value to your home.</p>
